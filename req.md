  - Embeddable; attach to any html node + usable in an iframe etc.
  - Output JSON config file and/or html snippets
  - Purely local - must work without any backend services
  - Light on dependencies
  - Mimic the meta system defined in chartcloud
  - Customizable property sets
  - Data can be defined in a grid, imported from a CSV file, or imported from a URL (requires that the editor is running through an actual http server due to cross origin policies)
  - Allow for multiple editor widgets on the same page; no global config data in other words.
